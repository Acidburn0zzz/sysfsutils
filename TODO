Library:
--------
- Implement a better device tree, so we can eventually walk the tree.
- Add write attribute write commands:
	sysfs_write_attribute()
	sysfs_write_attribute_value()
- Possibly add abstract data list to make device tree easier and to
	give calling applications a means to easily manage large lists
	of devices.
- Make bus lists of devices using topology.
- Need to properly set errno. 

Commands:
---------
- Add capability to just take a device as an argument.
- Add topology tree view.
- Need to clean up error messages.
- Clean up how attribute values are printed.
