1. Introduction
---------------

This package's purpose is to provide a set of utilities for interfacing
with sysfs, a virtual filesystem in Linux kernel versions 2.5+ that
provides a tree of system devices. While a filesystem is a very useful
interface, we've decided to provide a stable programming interface
that will hopefully make it easier for applications to query system devices
and their attributes.

This package currently includes:

- libsysfs: a library for accessing system devices.
- systool: an application to view system device information by bus, class,
	and topology.
- A number of example usage routines in the "test" directory.
- A comprehensive testsuite, also shipped as part of the "test" directory. This
	testsuite can be used to test _all_ the APIs exported by Libsysfs. 
	Please refer the libsysfs.txt file in the "docs" directory for 
	details as to how to use the testsuite.


2. How to Install
-----------------

Run the "configure" script to generate Makefiles. Use "make" to build the
library and utilities. Use "make install" to install the binaries and the
header files. "make uninstall" will delete all installed binaries and
header files.

The header files are installed in /usr/include/sysfs by default. In case
a different path is desired, specify "includedir=xxx" while running configure
as in

./configure --includedir="path for header installs"
