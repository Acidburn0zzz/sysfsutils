1. Introduction
---------------

This package's purpose is to provide a set of utilities for interfacing
with sysfs, a virtual filesystem in Linux kernel versions 2.5+ that
provides a tree of system devices. While a filesystem is a very useful
interface, we've decided to provide a stable programming interface
that will hopefully make it easier for applications to query system devices
and their attributes.

This package currently includes:

- libsysfs: a library for accessing system devices.
- lsbus: a small application to query system bus information.
- systool: an application to view system device information by bus, class,
	and topology.
